# TetrisGameWithPygame

# Ideas for the game
1. Forecast where tetris piece will land (by showing hollow squares)
2. Menu with choices (difficulty, speed, grid size).
3. Start game, Quit, pause, resume
4. Points
5. Levels. Difficulty increases as levels increase. Faster falling pieces.
6. High score records with your name.
7. Earn specials pieces, like bomb that blows up.
